## Challenge: 
1. partial selling when hit stop loss? https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt/issues/186
2. vectorbt - group_by=True, # 0 vs 1 vs True vs False -what their meaning
4. market limit - e.g., buy limit, sell limit, buy stop, sell stop, trailing stop loss
5. dividend reinvestment?

## Suggestion
- can begin to layer in trade related optimizations. Think entry/exit, holding periods, market/limit orders, allocation strategy etc
- consider a volatility targeting strategy to smooth out the vol spikes that happen in these tech stocks
