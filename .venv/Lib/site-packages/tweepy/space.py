class Space(HashableID, DataMapping):
    """Spaces allow expression and interaction via live audio conversations.
    The Space data dictionary contains relevant metadata about a Space; all the
    details are updated in real time.

    User objects can found and expanded in the user resource. These objects are
    available for expansion by adding at least one of ``host_ids``,
    ``creator_id``, ``speaker_ids``, ``mentioned_user_ids`` to the
    ``expansions`` query parameter.

    Unlike Tweets, Spaces are ephemeral and become unavailable after they end
    or when they are canceled by their creator. When your app handles Spaces
    data, you are responsible for returning the most up-to-date information,
    and must remove data that is no longer available from the platform. The
    `Spaces lookup endpoints`_ can help you ensure you respect the usersâ€™
    expectations and intent.
