# OpenBB Terminal : `Integration Testing`

This document is part of the `OpenBB Terminal` library documentation.

It aims to provide necessary information in order to:

- Build `integration tests`
- Run `integration tests`
- Identify errors noted from `integration tests`

## 1.1. Why have integration tests ?

The purpose of integration tests is to provide standard usage examples that can be programmatically run
to make sure that a specific functionality of the terminal and the process to utilize that functionality
is working properly.

## 2. How to build integration tests ?

Integration tests themselves are the same as manually running a certain series of steps. As a result,
writing tests is easy because the integration test script is just the total list of steps necessary to
use a command, command with specific argument, or series of commands.

When you contribute a new feature to the Terminal, it's important that integration tests are added for
this particular feature. It is a part of the Checklist for the PR to be approved.

All the `integration tests` should be insides the `scripts` folder. The naming convention for scripts
should be `test_<menu>_<command>.openbb` if you are testing a specific command or `test_<menu>.openbb`
if you are testing the entire menu. However, it is encouraged to create as specific of integration tests
as possible to identify errors more precisely. Additionally, all tests must end with the `exit` command.

These files can be given dynamic output with the following syntax `${key=default}`. Please note that
both key and default can only contain letters and numbers with NO special characters. Each dynamic
argument MUST contain a key and a default value.

## 3. How integration tests detect bugs ?

When an unhandled exception is raised during a test session, this is considered a bug. The exception is caught and we save its traceback and other details to debug afterwards.

### Script examples

Testing a specific command and it's arguments:

```zsh
script: test_alt_covid.openbb
- - - - - - - - - -
alternative
covid
country Australia
reset
slopes
country US
ov
country Russia
deaths
country United Kingdom
cases
country Canada
rates
exit
```

Testing an entire menu

```zsh
test_stocks_options.openbb
- - - - - - - - - -
stocks
options
screen
view
view high_IV
set high_IV
scr
q
unu
calc
load aapl
exp 0
pcr
info
chains
oi
vol
voi
hist 100
grhist 100
plot -x ltd -y iv
parity
binom
load spy
vsurf
exit
```

## 3. How to run integration tests ?

### Conda Terminal

After navigating to the location of the OpenBBTerminal repo, one can run integration tests in a
few different ways using the wildcard expression. Please include a `-t` with `terminal.py` to run
the tests.

- To see the available tests, use `--list` or `-l`:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -l
    ```

- Run all integration tests:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t
    ```

- Run some integration tests, by number, name or path:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -p 0 10 22
    ```

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -p stocks cryptocurrency
    ```

    *This specific example runs all of the stocks integration tests. One can use this same format for different tests.*

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t openbb_terminal/core/integration_tests/scripts/forex
    ```

- Run one integration test:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -p alternative/test_alt_covid.openbb
    ```

    *Note that the base path is `OpenBBTerminal/openbb_terminal/core/integration_tests/scripts`.*

- Skip some integration tests:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -p alternative -s alternative/test_alt_covid.openbb
    ```

- Run integration tests with arguments by adding --key=value:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t --ticker=aapl
    ```

- To see the possible keys, use `--help` or `-h`:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -h
    ```

- To save time, the tests are run in parallel by default. You can choose the number of subprocesses used with `--subproc`. The default number of subprocesses is the minimum between the number of scripts to run and the number of CPUs of your machine.

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t forex --subproc 4
    ```

- To see terminal outputs being printed during the test session, use `--verbose` or `-v`:

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t -v
    ```

- In verbose mode the tests are run sequentially, by default. This avoids mixing the outputs from several scripts in the console. If you still want to see the outputs during a parallel run, just specify the number of subprocesses you wish to launch with verbose flag, it will force multiprocessing.

    ```zsh
    python terminal.py -t forex --subproc 7 -v
    ```

### Installer Terminal

Integration tests can also be used on installers, which is a packaged version of the conda terminal.
More information on how to build an installer can be found [here](/build/README.md).
To run the tests on installers you can use the same syntax as above, just substitute `python terminal.py` by the full path to OpenBBTerminal executable (not the shortcut!). See the examples below for MacOS.

- Run all integration tests:

    ```zsh
    /Full/Path/To/OpenBB\ Terminal/.OpenBB/OpenBBTerminal -t
    ```

- Run some integration tests:

    ```zsh
    /Full/Path/To/OpenBB\ Terminal/.OpenBB/OpenBBTerminal -t forex stocks
    ```

- Run one integration test:

    ```zsh
    /Full/Path/To/OpenBB\ Terminal/.OpenBB/OpenBBTerminal -t alternative/test_alt_covid.openbb
    ```

## 4. Test report

The console report has 3 sections: progress, failures and summary.

- Progress
    1. Shows the tests collected and skipped in the current session
    2. Informs if tests are running in parallel or sequentially
    3. Displays the result of tests already finished

- Failures
    1. Traceback
    2. Exception type
    3. Detail with exception message

- Summary
    1. Displays tests failed with the last command called and how long they took to run

- Example

```zsh
(obb) % python terminal.py -t forex
============================ integration test session starts =============================
Collecting scripts from: /Users/username/OpenBBTerminal/openbb_terminal/core/integration_tests/scripts


* Collected 7 script(s)...
* Skipping 0 script(s)...
* Running 7 script(s) in 7 parallel subprocess(es)...
