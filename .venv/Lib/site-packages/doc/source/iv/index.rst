Instrumental Variable Estimation
--------------------------------
:ref:`iv-introduction` provides a brief overview of the available IV
estimators. :ref:`iv-module-reference-models` contains a complete reference to
available estimation methods. :ref:`iv-module-reference-results` discusses the
results classes returned after estimating a model as well as model
specification tests. Other components of the models such as covariance
estimators, GMM weighting estimators and the results are presented in
:ref:`iv-module-reference`.

`Basic Examples`_ shows basic usage through examples from Wooldridge's
introductory text book and `Advanced Examples`_
shows more advanced examples following the examples in Cameron and Trivedi's Stata
introduction.

:ref:`iv-mathematical-notation` contains a concise explanation of the formulas
used in estimating parameters, estimating covariances and conducting hypothesis
tests.
