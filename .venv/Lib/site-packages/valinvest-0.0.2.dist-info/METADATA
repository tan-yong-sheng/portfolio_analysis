## Introduction

The aim of the package is to evaluate a stock according to his fundamentals by setting a score and identify buy and sells opportunies through technical indicators.

## Methodology description

The scoring methodology is based on Joseph Piotroski's study ([Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/~/media/FE874EE65F624AAEBD0166B1974FD74D.pdf)). The F-Score is used to help financial investment decisions by finding the best value stocks on the market.<br>

> The Piostroski score is calculated based on 9 criteria divided into 3 groups:
> 
> #### Profitability
>
> - Return on Assets (1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise)
> - Operating Cash Flow (1 point if it is positive in the current year, 0 otherwise)
> - Change in Return of Assets (ROA) (1 point if ROA is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)
> - Accruals (1 point if Operating Cash Flow/Total Assets is higher than ROA in the current year, 0 otherwise)
>
> #### Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds
>
> - Change in Leverage (long-term) ratio (1 point if the ratio is lower this year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)
> - Change in Current ratio (1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)
> - Change in the number of shares (1 point if no new shares were issued during the last year)
>
> #### Operating Efficiency
>
> - Change in Gross Margin (1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)
> - Change in Asset Turnover ratio (1 point if it is higher in the current year compared to the previous one, 0 otherwise)
> 

This software calculates an alternate version of the F-Score as follows:
#### Growth
- Net Revenue
- EBITDA
- Earnings per share (EPS)

#### Profitability
- CROIC
- ROIC

#### Debts
- EBITDA cover ratio
- Debt coverage

#### Market sensibility
- Beta

#### Investment
- Equity buyback
