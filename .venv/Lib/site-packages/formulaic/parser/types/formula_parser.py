@dataclass
class FormulaParser:
    """
    The base formula parser API.

    The role of subclasses of this class is to transform a string representation
    of a formula into a (structured) sequence of `Term` instances that can be
    evaluated by materializers and ultimately rendered into model matrices.

    This class can be subclassed to customize this behavior. The three phases of
    formula parsing are split out into separate methods to make this easier.
    They are:
        - get_tokens: Which returns an iterable of `Token` instances. By default
            this uses `tokenize()` and handles the addition/removal of the
            intercept.
        - get_ast: Which converts the iterable of `Token`s into an abstract
            syntax tree. By default this uses `tokens_to_ast()` and the nominated
            `OperatorResolver` instance.
        - get_terms: Which evaluates the abstract syntax tree and returns an
            iterable of `Term`s.
    Only the `get_terms()` method is essential from an API perspective.
