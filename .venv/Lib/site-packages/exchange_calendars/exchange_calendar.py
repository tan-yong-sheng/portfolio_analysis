class ExchangeCalendar(ABC):
    """Representation of timing information of a single market exchange.

    The timing information comprises sessions, open/close times and, for
    exchanges that observe an intraday break, break_start/break_end times.

    For exchanges that do not observe an intraday break a session
    represents a contiguous set of minutes. Where an exchange observes
    an intraday break a session represents two contiguous sets of minutes
    separated by the intraday break.

    Each session is labeled as the date that the session represents.

    For each session, we store the open and close time together with, for
    those exchanges with breaks, the break start and break end. All times
    are defined as UTC.

    Note that a session may start on the day prior to the session label or
    end on the day following the session label. Such behaviour is common
    for calendars that represent futures exchanges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : default: later of 20 years ago or first supported start date.
        First calendar session will be `start`, if `start` is a session, or
        first session after `start`. Cannot be earlier than any date
        returned by class method `bound_min`.

    end : default: earliest of 1 year from 'today' or last supported end
        date. Last calendar session will be `end`, if `end` is a session,
        or last session before `end`. Cannot be later than any date
        returned by class method `bound_max`.

    side : default: "left"
        Define which of session open/close and break start/end should
            be treated as a trading minute:
        "left" - treat session open and break_start as trading minutes,
            do not treat session close or break_end as trading minutes.
        "right" - treat session close and break_end as trading minutes,
            do not treat session open or break_start as tradng minutes.
        "both" - treat all of session open, session close, break_start
            and break_end as trading minutes.
        "neither" - treat none of session open, session close,
            break_start or break_end as trading minutes.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `start` is earlier than the earliest supported start date.
        If `end` is later than the latest supported end date.
        If `start` parses to a later date than `end`.

    Notes
    -----
    Exchange calendars were originally defined for the Zipline package from
    Quantopian under the package 'trading_calendars'. Since 2021 they have
    been maintained under the 'exchange_calendars' package (a fork of
    'trading_calendars') by an active community of contributing users.

    Some calendars have defined start and end bounds within which
    contributors have endeavoured to ensure the calendar's accuracy and
    outside of which the calendar would not be accurate. These bounds
    are enforced such that passing `start` or `end` as dates that are
    out-of-bounds will raise a ValueError. The bounds of each calendar are
    exposed via the `bound_min` and `bound_max` class methods.

    Many calendars do not have bounds defined (in these cases `bound_min`
    and/or `bound_max` return None). These calendars can be created through
    any date range although it should be noted that the earlier the start
    date, the greater the potential for inaccuracies.

    In all cases, no guarantees are offered as to the accuracy of any
    calendar.

        Create a trading index of given `period` over a given range of
        dates.

        NB. Which minutes the calendar treats as trading minutes, according
        to `self.side`, is irrelevant in the evaluation of the trading
        index.

        NB. Execution time is related to the number of indices created. The
        longer the range of dates covered and/or the shorter the period
        (i.e. higher the frequency), the longer the execution. Whilst an
        index with 4000 indices might be created in a couple of
        miliseconds, a high frequency index with 2 million indices might
        take a second or two.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start
            Timestamp representing start of index.

            If `start` is passed as a date then the first indice will be:
                if `start` is a session, then the first indice of that
                    session (i.e. the left side of the first indice will be
                    the session open).
                otherwise, the first indice of the nearest session
                    following `start`.

            If `start` is passed as a minute then the first indice will be:
                if `start` coincides with (the left side of*) an indice,
                    then that indice.
                otherwise the nearest indice to `start` (with a left side*)
                    that is later than `start`.
                * if `intervals` is True (default)

            `start` will be interpreted as a date if it is timezone-naive
            and does not have a time component (or any time component is
            00:00). Otherwise `start` will be interpreted as a time.

            If `period` is one day ("1d") then `start` must be passed as
            a date. The first indice will be either `start`, if `start` is
            a session, or otherwise the nearest session following `start`.

        end
            Timestamp representing end of index.

            If `end` is passed as a date then the last indice will be:
                if `end` is a session, then the last indice of that
                    session (i.e. either the right side of the final indice
                    will be the session close or the final indice will
                    contain the session close).
                otherwise, the last indice of the nearest session
                    preceeding `end`.

            If `end` is passed as a minute then the last indice will be:
                if `end` coincides with (the right side of*) an indice,
                    then that indice.
                otherwise the nearest indice to `end` (with a right side*)
                    that is earlier than `end`.
                * if `intervals` is True (default)

            `end` will be interpreted as a date if it is timezone-naive
            and does not have a time component (or any time component is
            00:00). Otherwise `start` will be interpreted as a time.

            If `period` is one day ("1d") then `end` must be passed as
            a date. The last indice will be either `end`, if `end` is
            a session, or otherwise the nearest session prceeding `end`.

        period
            If `intervals` is True, the length of each interval. If
            `intervals` is False, the distance between indices. Period
            should be passed as a pd.Timedelta or a str that's acceptable
            as a single input to pd.Timedelta. `period` cannot be greater
            than 1 day.

            Examples of valid `period` input:
                pd.Timedelta(minutes=15), pd.Timedelta(minutes=15, hours=2)
                '15min', '15T', '1H', '4h', '1d', '30s', '2s', '500ms'.
            Examples of invalid `period` input:
                '15minutes', '2d'.

        intervals : default: True
            True to return trading index as a pd.IntervalIndex with indices
            representing explicit intervals.

            False to return trading index as a pd.DatetimeIndex with
            indices that implicitely represent a period according to
            `closed`.

            If `period` is '1d' then trading index will be returned as a
            pd.DatetimeIndex.

        closed : {"left", "right", "both", "neither"}
            (ignored if `period` is '1d'.)

            If `intervals` is True, the side that intervals should be
            closed on. Must be either "left" or "right" (any time during a
            session must belong to one interval and one interval only).

            If `intervals` is False, the side of each period that an
            indice should be defined. The first and last indices of each
            (sub)session will be defined according to:
                "left" - include left side of first period, do not include
                    right side of last period.
                "right" - do not include left side of first period, include
                    right side of last period.
                "both" - include both left side of first period and right
                    side of last period.
                "neither" - do not include either left side of first period
                    or right side of last period.
            NB if `period` is not a factor of the (sub)session length then
            "right" or "both" will result in an indice being defined after
            the (sub)session close. See `force_close` and
            `force_break_close`.

        force_close : default: False
            (ignored if `force` is passed.)
            (ignored if `period` is '1d')
            (irrelevant if `intervals` is False and `closed` is "left" or
            "neither")

            Defines behaviour if right side of a session's last period
            falls after the session close.

            If True, defines right side of this period as session close.

            If False, defines right side of this period after the session
            close. In this case the represented period will include a
            non-trading period.

        force_break_close : default: False
            (ignored if `force` is passed.)
            (ignored if `period` is '1d'.)
            (irrelevant if `intervals` is False and `closed` is "left" or
            "neither.)

            Defines behaviour if right side of last pre-break period falls
            after the start of the break.

            If True, defines right side of this period as break start.

            If False, defines right side of this period after the break
            start. In this case the represented period will include a
            non-trading period.

        force : optional
            (ignored if `period` is '1d'.)
            (irrelevant if `intervals` is False and `closed` is "left" or
            "neither.)

            Convenience option to set both `force_close` and
            `force_break_close`. If passed then values passsed to
            `force_close` and `force_break_close` will be ignored.

        curtail_overlaps : default: False
            (ignored if `period` is '1d')
            (irrelevant if (`intervals` is False) or (`force_close` and
            `force_break_close` are both True).)

            Defines action to take if a period ends after the start of the
            next period. (This can occur if `period` is longer
            than a break or the gap between one session's close and the
            next session's open.)

                If True, the right of the earlier of two overlapping
                periods will be curtailed to the left of the latter period.
                (NB consequently the period length will not be constant for
                all periods.)

                If False, will raise IntervalsOverlapError.

        ignore_breaks : default: False
            (ignored if `period` is '1d')
            (irrelevant if no session has a break)

            Defines whether trading index should respect session breaks.

            If False, treat sessions with breaks as comprising independent
            morning and afternoon subsessions.

            If True, treat all sessions as continuous, ignoring any
            breaks.

        parse : default: True
            Determines if `start` and `end` values are parsed. If these
            arguments are passed as tz-naive pd.Timestamp with no time
            component then can pass `parse` as False to save around
            500µs on the execution.

        align : default: pd.Timedelta(1, "T")
            Anchor the first indice of each session such that it aligns
            with the nearest occurrence of a specific fraction of an hour.

            Pass as a pd.Timedelta or a str that's acceptable as a single
            input to pd.Timedelta. Pass +ve values to shift indices
            forwards, -ve values to shift indices backwards.

            Valid values are (or equivalent):
                "2T", "3T", "4T", "5T", "6T", "10T", "12T", "15T", "20T",
                "30T", "-2T", "-4T", "-5T", "-6T", "-10T", "-12T", "-15T",
                "-20T", "-30T"

            For example, if `intervals` is True and `period` is '5T' then
            the first interval of a session with open time as 07:59 would
            be:
                07:59 - 08:04 if `align` is pd.Timedelta(1, "T")  (default)
                08:00 - 08:05 if `align` is '5T'
                07:55 - 08:00 if `align` is '-5T'

            Subsequent indices will be similarly shifted.

            Note: A session's indices will not be shifted if the session
            open already aligns with `align`. For example, if the open time
            were 08:00 then the first interval will always have a left side
            as 08:00 regardless of `align`.

        align_pm : default: True
            (ignored if `ignore_break` is True)
            (irrelevant if no session has a break)

            Anchor the first indice of each afternoon subsession such that
            it aligns with the nearest occurrence of a specific fraction of
            an hour.

                True: (default) Treat as `align`.

                False: Do not shift post-break indices.

                pd.Timedelta or str: Align post-break indices to the
                nearest occurence of this fraction of an hour. Valid values
                as for `align`.

        Returns
        -------
        pd.IntervalIndex or pd.DatetimeIndex
            Trading index.

            If `intervals` is False or `period` is '1d' then returned as a
                pd.DatetimeIndex.
            If `intervals` is True (default) returned as pd.IntervalIndex.

        Raises
        ------
